## NASA APOD Code Challenge
For this challenge, you will create a single page app that displays the NASA picture of the day. 
It should: 
1. Allow a user to enter a date to return the picture of the day, for that given date.
2. Allow a user to click a “Random Date” button, and get a random picture for the random date.
3. Have a sensible layout, and enough styling to give it a clean look.

Use this boilerplate project to begin. It was created using create-react-app. I intentionally kept it simple and I wanted to allow you to use whichever libraries or tools you want, if you want to use any at all.
The project requires a datepicker component, so there is a component with react-datepicker that you can build from in the components directory.
I've also added a .env file with an API key from NASA to use.

**Quick note -- The picture of the day API will return either a photo or video. Make sure to create logic to handle both types.**
