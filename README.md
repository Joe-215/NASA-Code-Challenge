## NASA APOD Code Challenge
For this challenge, you will create a single page app that displays the NASA picture of the day. 
It should allow a user to enter a date to return the picture of the day, for that given date.
It should allow a user to click a “Random Date” button, and get a random picture for the random date.
It should have a sensible layout, and enough styling to give it a clean look.

Below is an example layout that includes the requirements above. Feel free to use another layout, or use completely different styling. 
Just be sure it has the same functionality and shows the title, picture, and description from the api response.

Use this boilerplate project to begin. I intentionally kept it simple and I wanted to allow you to use whichever libraries or tools you want, if you want to use any at all.
The project requires a datepicker component, so there is a component with react-datepicker that you can build from in the components directory.
I've also added a .env file with an API key from NASA to use.

Quick note -- The picture of the day API will return either a photo or video. Make sure to create logic to handle both types.
