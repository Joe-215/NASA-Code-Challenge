## NASA APOD Code Challenge
For this challenge, you will create a single page app that displays the NASA picture of the day. 
It should:
1. Show the image, title, and description from the api response.
2. Allow a user to enter a date to return the picture of the day, for that given date.
3. Allow a user to click a “Random Date” button, and get a random picture for the random date.
4. Have a sensible layout, and enough styling to give it a clean look.

Check out the sample-image directory, for an example of what the end result should be. Feel free to use a different layout, or styles. The important thing is that it looks clean, and has the functionality mentioned in the above requirements. 

Use this boilerplate project to begin. It was created using create-react-app. We intentionally kept it simple and we wanted to allow you to use whichever libraries or tools you want, if you want to use any at all.
The project requires a datepicker component, so there is a component with react-datepicker that you can build from in the components directory.

We've also added a .env file with an API key from NASA to use.

**Quick note -- The picture of the day API will return either a photo or video. Make sure to create logic to handle both types.**
